Gulp-concat-vendor will speed up your building process by separating external libraries from your project files.

## Usage

```javascript
var concat-vendor = require('gulp-concat-vendor');

gulp.task('scripts', function() {
  	gulp.src('./scripts/vendor/*')
		.pipe(vendor('vendor.js'))
		.pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/scripts'));  
});
```

This will concat all external libraries installed by [Bower](http://bower.io/). It will sort all files depending on their dependencies before concating. Libraries not installed with [Bower](http://bower.io/) - that is, when the bower.json file was not found - will be skipped.


Libraries like [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) don't use a bower.json file. 
Therefor you can add files manually to the concatenation, like so:

```javascript
var concat-vendor = require('gulp-concat-vendor');

gulp.task('scripts', function() {
	gulp.src([
		'./scripts/vendor/*',
		'./scripts/vendor/modernizr/modernizr.js'
	])
	.pipe(vendor('vendor.js'))
	.pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/scripts'));
});
```
